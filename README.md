# Predicting-Heart-Stroke
Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM etc with 5 fold cross validation.
This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:



1. Support Vector Machine (rbf) (Scikit-learn)
2. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
3. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
4. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
5. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)


Accuracy achieved: 91% (SVM)
